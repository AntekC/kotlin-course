## SMD

Simple Markdown (SMD) is a simplified subset of Markdown with essential syntax elements, including headers, paragraphs,
line breaks, lists, horizontal lines, emphasis (italic, bold, bold-italic), inline code, and code blocks.

This Kotlin mini-library provides a DSL to create SMD documents. Running the program with a file path as an argument
will generate an SMD document matching the content in example.md and save it to the specified path.
